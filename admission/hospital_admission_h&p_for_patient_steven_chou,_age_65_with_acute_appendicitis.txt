Assessment and Plan:
65-year-old male with a history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and cholecystectomy presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, consistent with acute appendicitis.

1. Acute appendicitis
   - Obtain CBC, CMP, lipase, urinalysis, and CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other etiologies
   - Consult general surgery for evaluation and management
   - Administer IV fluids, antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole), and pain control as needed
   - Monitor vital signs and clinical status closely
2. Diabetes
   - Check blood glucose levels and HbA1c
   - Continue home medications and adjust insulin regimen as needed
3. Atrial fibrillation
   - Continue Eliquis and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - Obtain baseline EKG and telemetry monitoring
4. Hypertension
   - Continue home medications (Lisinopril, Metoprolol) and monitor blood pressure closely
5. Cholecystectomy
   - Obtain surgical history and ensure no complications related to the previous surgery
6. DVT prophylaxis
   - Initiate mechanical prophylaxis with sequential compression devices
   - Assess the need for pharmacological prophylaxis based on surgical recommendations and bleeding risk
