Assessment and Plan:
Mr. Steven Chou is a 65-year-old male presenting with dizziness. Given his age, past medical history of atrial fibrillation, and the nature of his symptoms, the differential diagnosis includes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, and less likely, a cerebrovascular event or cardiac arrhythmia.

Plan:
1. Order an ECG to assess for any cardiac arrhythmias or ischemic changes
2. Check orthostatic vital signs to evaluate for orthostatic hypotension
3. Perform Dix-Hallpike maneuver to assess for BPPV
4. Consider referral to ENT for further evaluation of vestibular function if symptoms persist
5. Adjust medications as needed based on findings (e.g., optimize blood pressure control, review anticoagulation)
6. Educate patient on safety measures to prevent falls and schedule a follow-up visit in [insert timeframe] to reassess symptoms and response to interventions
