Assessment and Plan:

5. Schedule a follow-up visit in [timeframe] to reassess pain control and functional status
6. Discuss potential long-term management options, such as intra-articular corticosteroid injections or joint replacement surgery, if conservative measures fail to provide adequate relief.
