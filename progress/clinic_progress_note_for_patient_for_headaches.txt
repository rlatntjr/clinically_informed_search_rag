Assessment and Plan:
Mr. Steven Chou is a 65-year-old male presenting with headaches. Given his age and cardiovascular risk factors, it is essential to rule out potentially serious causes of headaches, such as temporal arteritis, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesions.

1. Order a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) to screen for infection or inflammation.
2. Consider neuroimaging (CT or MRI of the brain) to exclude intracranial pathology.
3. Perform a thorough neurological examination and assess for any focal deficits or signs of increased intracranial pressure.
4. Review the patient's current medications and consider potential drug interactions or side effects that may contribute to headaches (e.g., Eliquis, Plavix).
5. Provide symptomatic relief with over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) if not contraindicated.
6. Schedule a follow-up visit in [X] weeks to reassess symptoms and review test results.
7. Educate the patient on lifestyle modifications, such as stress reduction, proper sleep hygiene, and maintaining a headache diary to identify potential triggers.

If the workup is unremarkable and the headaches persist, consider referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and management.
